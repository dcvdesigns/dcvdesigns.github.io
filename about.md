I began 3D printing in early 2020 on a Monoprice Select Mini v2 — a great starter machine, but its tiny 120×120 mm build area quickly pushed me to level up. By that summer, I had upgraded to a Creality Ender 3 and started seriously experimenting with multi-color prints, new materials, and designing my own parts from scratch. That’s when I opened a short-lived Etsy shop focused mainly on custom lamps and night lights.

As my projects grew larger, I added an Ender CR-10S to handle bigger formats and debuted my first custom-designed LED Christmas Tree lamp at a craft fair in winter 2022. A second craft fair in November 2023 funded a major upgrade — the Bambu Lab P1S — unlocking faster production, cleaner multicolor work, and more ambitious design possibilities. Along the way, I began designing and printing one-off custom pieces for individuals — everything from functional solutions to display-worthy, highly personal creations.

I’ve since retired the Ender machines entirely and expanded to a full Bambu lineup — adding an A1 Mini for smaller parts and a full A1 in 2025 as I continued to push my design capabilities ahead of my third craft fair. What began as a hobby has evolved into a design-driven obsession — blending functional fabrication, modern aesthetics, and the joy of creating physical pieces that genuinely resonate with people.

If you’re looking for a custom 3D design or need a print brought to life — let’s build something together.
