DCV Designs is a small studio creating **custom 3D‑printed pieces** — from lightboxes and layered signs to seasonal decor and practical accessories. We focus on clean finishes, durable materials (PLA & PETG), and thoughtful design details.

## What We make
- **Custom lightboxes** (team logos, landmarks, monograms)
- **Layered signs & desk art**
- **Holiday & seasonal pieces**
- **Automotive accessories** (e.g., hitch covers)
- **One‑off requests** — got an idea? Let’s make it

## How it works
1. **Tell us about your idea** — size, colors, where it’ll live, any inspiration.
2. **I propose a design** — materials, timeline, and estimate.
3. **Print & finish** — I share progress pics where helpful.
