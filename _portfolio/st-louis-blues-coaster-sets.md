  Each design interprets the Blues’ branding through a different visual lens: circular coasters use radiating lines to suggest motion and energy, while square versions highlight logo geometry, instrument motifs, and treble-clef influences. Printed in multi-color PLA with crisp, dimensional contrast, the sets emphasize craftsmanship and the interplay between sport and design — uniting structure, movement, and team spirit in functional art form.
