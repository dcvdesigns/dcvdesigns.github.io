  Each coaster combines layered geometry with patriotic color blocking to create a modern visual rhythm centered on the Missouri state outline. The alternating striped and concentric ring motifs highlight the precision and depth achievable through multi-material 3D printing. Completed with a matching embossed caddy, the set strikes a balance between design-forward experimentation and local identity — a creative tribute to the Show-Me State rendered in clean, thoughtful design.
