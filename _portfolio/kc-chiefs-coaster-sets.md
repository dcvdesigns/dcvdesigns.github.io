  This project includes multiple designs centered around the Chiefs’ iconic branding, from clean square emblems featuring helmets and arrowheads to dynamic radial patterns that evoke movement and energy. Each set was modeled and printed in durable PLA with precise multi-color layering to achieve crisp contrast and depth. Together, the designs highlight how subtle shifts in shape, proportion, and texture can reinterpret familiar team iconography into refined, display-worthy pieces.
