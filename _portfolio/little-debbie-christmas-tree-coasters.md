  This joyful coaster set includes four individually detailed Christmas tree coasters along with a matching storage caddy to keep them neatly organized when not in use. Each piece is 3D-printed in layered dimensional color to mimic the nostalgic look of Little Debbie’s beloved holiday snack cakes — perfect for hot cocoa stations, dessert tables, or cozy holiday décor setups. Equal parts functional and smile-inducing, they’re a conversation piece that brings childhood holiday memories straight to the coffee table.
