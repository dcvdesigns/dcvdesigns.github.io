  This set explores the challenge of blending distinct team identities within a single design language. Each coaster features layered colorwork and dimensional emblems representing the Cardinals, Blues, Battlehawks, and CITY SC — balanced through consistent geometry and shared framing. Printed in durable PLA with precision multi-color layering, the series was designed as both a technical showcase and a tribute to the enduring spirit of St. Louis sports.
