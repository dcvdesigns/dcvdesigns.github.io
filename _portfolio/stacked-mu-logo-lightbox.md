  This 3D-printed lightbox showcases the iconic stacked MU emblem in a bold architectural style, inspired by illuminated signage found across the University of Missouri campus. Printed in durable PLA and engineered with a cleanly integrated power connector and LED light strip, it allows the included external power pack to plug in discreetly with no exposed wiring. The warm gold backlighting casts a premium glow, making it a standout display piece for offices, fan caves, dorm rooms, or graduation gift tables.
