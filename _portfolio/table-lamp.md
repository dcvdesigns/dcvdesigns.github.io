  This sculptural table lamp features a softly faceted ripple-style base paired with a diffused textured shade — designed to create a calm, ambient glow rather than harsh task lighting. The base is 3D-printed using an oversized 0.8 mm nozzle (double the typical 0.4 mm standard), producing intentionally visible yet refined layer lines that add a tactile, ceramic-like presence without sacrificing polish. Paired with a textured shade that softly warms when lit, this piece brings modern serenity to bedrooms, workspaces, or relaxation corners — a functional design object that feels both contemporary and handcrafted.
