  These sets explore how iconic surface motifs can be translated into tactile, dimensional design. Each pattern is rendered in PLA using precise color layering and relief depth to evoke the texture and rhythm of woven fabrics. Subtle palette variations bring modern contrast while preserving the visual cadence of their classic origins. Paired with coordinating caddies, the collection bridges traditional pattern language with modern fabrication — elegant, versatile, and quietly nostalgic.
