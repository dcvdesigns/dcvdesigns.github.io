  A minimalist holiday display featuring Santa’s sleigh in elegant silhouette, framed in bold contrasting color for a refined seasonal statement. 3D-printed with layered dimensional depth, it evokes classic Christmas imagery in a clean, design-forward form — ideal for mantels, entry spaces, or décor arrangements where subtle sophistication is preferred over bright novelty.
