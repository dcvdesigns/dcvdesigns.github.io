  This project showcases a custom production run of over 60 neckerchief slides created for Troop 35 in St. Charles, Missouri — designed with their official troop branding and batch printed with uniform precision. Each slide was 3D-printed in durable PLA, cleaned, finished, and individually packaged for Court of Honor distribution.

  Beyond slides, we offer scalable custom production for scout units, including personalized gifts, crossover tokens, event swag, patrol gear, and fundraiser-ready items. Every order is produced with professional consistency and presentation-ready packaging — ideal for councils, packs, and troops looking for high-quality, customized pieces that feel official, thoughtful, and memorable.
