  These designs reinterpret the Mizzou aesthetic through precise layering and controlled repetition, from the modern swirl motif of the round sets to helmet-emblem variations that balance athletic energy with graphic clarity. Each piece was printed in PLA with fine multi-color alignment and includes a matching caddy for cohesive presentation. Together, they capture the university’s timeless palette and spirited visual identity through refined, functional design.
