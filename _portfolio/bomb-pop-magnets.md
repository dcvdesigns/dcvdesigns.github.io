  These 3D-printed Bomb Pop refrigerator magnets bring instant summer nostalgia to your kitchen — inspired by the classic red, white, and blue popsicle that defined childhood summers. Each magnet is printed in smooth color-layered PLA with a realistic popsicle-stick detail and a strong neodymium magnet embedded inside for secure hold on any fridge or metal surface. Perfect as seasonal décor, 4th of July party accents, or fun retro gifts — and available in alternate color themes for custom event or personal flair.
